## [1.0.0] — 2026-09-21

First release. Five skills, 82 files, ~16k lines.

### Added

- **`clean-code-java`** — the original book (Java examples): naming, functions, comments,
  formatting, error handling, classes/SRP, unit tests/TDD, systems, concurrency, the
  refactoring case studies, and the 66-item smells-and-heuristics catalogue.
- **`clean-code-typescript`** — the labs42io adaptation: SOLID in TS, `type` vs `interface`,
  `readonly`/`as const` immutability, unions over `instanceof`, `Failable` result types,
  async/await and `Promise.all`, ESLint/Prettier.
- **`clean-code-javascript`** — the Ryan McDermott adaptation: argument counts and flag
  parameters, side effects and argument mutation, polymorphism over conditionals, closure
  privacy, ES6 classes and chaining, SOLID in an untyped language, callbacks → promises →
  async/await.
- **`clean-code-python`** — the zedr adaptation: type hints over type-prefixes, named regex
  groups, the two-argument limit with dataclass/NamedTuple/TypedDict parameter objects,
  generators, SOLID through ABCs and mixins, mypy-enforced LSP, duck-typed dependency
  inversion, DRY with the bad-abstraction caveat.
- **`clean-code-universal`** — the family's shared core, and the reason the set is published
  together. A language-agnostic distillation of the book cross-checked against the three
  adaptations above, organised on a **three-tier spine**: Tier 1 rules assume only that you
  can name something and run some verification; Tier 2 rules bind where a specific construct
  exists (parameter list, type system, substitutability mechanism, exception, test runner,
  thread, branching construct); Tier 3 is language-specific idiom, out of scope by name.
  Covers the languages with no dedicated sibling — Go, Rust, C#, C++, Kotlin, Ruby, PHP,
  Swift, Scala — and the declarative languages the book never addresses: YAML (Kubernetes,
  Helm, CI pipelines), Terraform/HCL, SQL, Bash, Dockerfile. Ships
  `references/declarative-translation.md`, a 53-row table stating per rule what it means
  where there are no functions, no classes and no unit tests, including the rules that
  genuinely **do not apply**.
- **Reciprocal routing across all five.** Every description names its siblings and ends by
  routing anything else to `clean-code-universal`, so the model loads one skill rather than
  guessing between five. Measured before release: universal fires on 45/45 prompts no
  sibling covers and 0/55 sibling-owned or oblique ones.
- **`NOTICE.md`** — per-skill sources and licences. The three community adaptations are MIT
  (notices reproduced verbatim); the book-derived material is not open source and is
  distributed as independently written restatement with citations.
