# NOTICE — sources, licensing and attribution

The `clean-code` plugin ships five knowledge-base skills. They are **not** a single
work under a single licence: each derives from a different source, and those sources
carry different terms. This file records what each skill derives from, and reproduces
the licence notices the source projects ship.

Read this before redistributing the plugin or any skill in it.

## Sources at a glance

| Skill | Derived from | Licence of the source |
|---|---|---|
| `clean-code-java` | *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship*, Robert C. Martin et al., Prentice Hall, 2008 | **Copyrighted book — not open source** |
| `clean-code-typescript` | [labs42io/clean-code-typescript](https://github.com/labs42io/clean-code-typescript) | MIT |
| `clean-code-javascript` | [ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) | MIT |
| `clean-code-python` | [zedr/clean-code-python](https://github.com/zedr/clean-code-python) | MIT |
| `clean-code-universal` | The book above, cross-checked against the three repositories above | **Mixed — see below** |

The three repositories are independent projects, not forks of one another.
Each states its own copyright; the notices below are reproduced verbatim from the
`LICENSE` file each project ships.

## The book-derived skills

`clean-code-java` and `clean-code-universal` restate rules, heuristics and the
smells-and-heuristics catalogue from *Clean Code*, a copyrighted book. This
repository distributes **no part of the book's text**: the skills are independently written
restatements of its rules, with citations pointing back to the chapters they came
from, and code examples written for the skill rather than copied from the book.

Ideas, rules and methods are not copyrightable; particular expression is. These
skills are distributed on that basis. They are a study and reference aid and are
no substitute for the book — buy it:

> Martin, Robert C. et al. *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software
> Craftsmanship.* Prentice Hall, 2008. ISBN 978-0132350884.

**This repository is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Robert C. Martin,
his co-authors, or Pearson / Prentice Hall.**

`clean-code-universal` additionally draws on the three MIT-licensed repositories
below; their notices apply to it as well.

## This repository

The packaging — the gateway plugin, the validation tooling, this notice, the changelog, and
the skill-authoring work that turned these sources into skills (chapter structure,
cheatsheets, glossaries, pattern catalogues, the tier spine and declarative
translation table in `clean-code-universal`) — is by Alexandros Korsakov and is
offered under the MIT licence, subject to the terms above for the underlying
material.
